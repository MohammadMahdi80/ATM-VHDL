# ATM-VHDL
A part of a university project for simulation ATM (my part is Balance inquiry).

# Explain project
* only Balance inquiry implemented in this repository.

# Simulation
Result of each action must show on 7-segment of one to four and determine by LED0 to LED7. 
reading this result from Isim is tedious and the other hand PyQt is powerful library for solving this problem.

* Result of simulation of Isim screen:

* run `test.py` and see simulation easily:
`clk` show clock of circuit and with clicking Next button amount of `clk` will increace.
depend on project description, LEDs are show action of user.
five buttom is available in FPGA board. in our app color of this buttons are change to show changes.

user in this step are in Balance Inquery
