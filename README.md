# ATM-VHDL
A part of a university project for simulation ATM (my part is Balance inquiry and Cash deposit).

# Explain project
* only Balance inquiry and Cash deposit implemented in this repository.

# Simulation
Result of each action must show on 7-segment of one to four and determine by LED0 to LED7. 
reading this result from Isim is tedious and the other hand PyQt is powerful library for solving this problem.

* Result of simulation of Isim screen:

* run `test.py` and see simulation esely:
